# Cusp patterning analysis 

cuspid_Erlang_2021_GamBoxCoxModel.r

his script fits a relationship between embryo weight and age in days post coitum (dpc) by GAM+boxcox or linear+boxcox tranformation. This is using the data of hundreds of embryos in weightTime_hamstermouse.txt. Then age is predicted for embryos used for cusp patterning and RNAseq samples.
